# Marketcap python Example

I was always interested when people say "is it really a trillion dollar company". 
So I built this simple page that uses the great yahoo money website to get the top companies by marketcap.

No keys and you're not stealing any secrets. It's all public information I'm pulling and using.

Have fun

## How to build it
- Close the repo
- pip install -r requirements
- python marketcap.py (and now hit http://localhost:3000

It's also has a vercel.json for easy deployment to a server (once you've added your own magic) 
and also I will be using it for demos in many presentations in the future as a simple project.

Note:
I'll probably add PipFiles and PyProject.toml files etc as also a learning and teaching website for python projects.
